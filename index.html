        <p>My hobby is tennis and it is my favorite hobby because it is also my favorite sport and I try to play it every day for over a hour and I also sometimes practice in the basement and it really means a lot and that is bassically it! I like tennis because it is not just your physical mindset you have to use but mental too and actually tennis is beasically using your mental part of the brain! I also like tennis because the sport is really energetic and I it is basically a hobby when I play it again and again every day!</p>
